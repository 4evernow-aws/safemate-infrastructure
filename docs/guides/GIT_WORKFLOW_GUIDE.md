## 🚀 **Development Workflow**

### **1. Starting Work**
```bash
# Always start from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create your team branch (if it doesn't exist)
git checkout -b team/wallet-widgets

# Or switch to existing team branch
git checkout team/wallet-widgets
git pull origin team/wallet-widgets
```

### **2. Daily Development**
```bash
# Start your day
git pull origin team/wallet-widgets

# Make your changes
# ... work on your features ...

# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new wallet widget functionality"

# Push to your team branch
git push origin team/wallet-widgets
```

### **3. Feature Completion**
```bash
# When your feature is ready for review
git push origin team/wallet-widgets

# Create Pull Request on GitHub:
# team/wallet-widgets → main
```

## 🔄 **Merge Process**

### **Pull Request Workflow**
1. **Create Pull Request** from team branch to main
2. **Code Review** by team lead or designated reviewer
3. **Address Feedback** if any changes requested
4. **Merge to Main** when approved
5. **Deploy to Production** from main branch

### **Merge Commands**
```bash
# After PR is approved and merged
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Update your team branch with latest main
git checkout team/wallet-widgets
git merge main
git push origin team/wallet-widgets
```
