# Hedera Network Configuration Fix

## Issue
The pre-production environment was incorrectly configured to use Hedera mainnet instead of testnet.

## Root Cause
The frontend environment configuration in `apps/web/safemate/.env.preprod` was set to `VITE_HEDERA_NETWORK=mainnet`, which was incorrect for the pre-production environment.

## Solution
1. **Updated Frontend Configuration**: Changed `VITE_HEDERA_NETWORK` from `mainnet` to `testnet` in `apps/web/safemate/.env.preprod`
2. **Commented Out Base Configuration**: Commented out the conflicting `VITE_HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet` line in `apps/web/safemate/.env` to prevent override
3. **Rebuilt Frontend**: Executed `npm run build` to compile the updated configuration
4. **Deployed to S3**: Uploaded the updated build to the S3 bucket `default-safemate-static-hosting`
5. **Invalidated CloudFront Cache**: Created cache invalidation to ensure updated files are served

## Files Modified
- `apps/web/safemate/.env.preprod`: Set `VITE_HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet`
- `apps/web/safemate/.env`: Commented out `VITE_HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet` line

## Verification
- Built JavaScript files now contain "Hedera Testnet" references
- Frontend correctly displays testnet configuration
- Pre-production environment now uses the correct Hedera network

## Current Configuration
- **Pre-Production Environment**: Uses Hedera **testnet**
- **Production Environment**: Will use Hedera **mainnet** (when deployed)
- **Development Environment**: Uses Hedera **testnet**

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - Pre-production environment now correctly uses Hedera testnet

## Next Steps
1. Update all documentation to reflect the correct network configuration
2. Ensure all AWS configurations for pre-production use the `preprod-` prefix
3. Verify that all API endpoints and Lambda functions are correctly configured for testnet
