# SafeMate Preprod Wallet Persistence Fix

## Issue Identified
The wallet creation was working (returning 200 with success), but the wallet wasn't being persisted to DynamoDB, causing the frontend to show "wallet not found" after creation.

## Root Cause
In `d:\safemate-infrastructure\services\user-onboarding\index-simple.js`, the `startOnboarding` function was creating mock wallet data but **not storing it in DynamoDB**. The code had this comment:

```javascript
// Note: We'll skip actual DynamoDB storage for now to test basic functionality
```

## Fix Applied

### 1. Added DynamoDB Storage
- **File**: `d:\safemate-infrastructure\services\user-onboarding\index-simple.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `PutCommand` import: `const { DynamoDBDocumentClient, GetCommand, QueryCommand, PutCommand } = require('@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb');`
  - Implemented actual DynamoDB storage in `startOnboarding` function:

```javascript
// Store wallet metadata in DynamoDB
const putCommand = new PutCommand({
  TableName: WALLET_METADATA_TABLE,
  Item: walletData
});

console.log('üîç Storing wallet in DynamoDB table:', WALLET_METADATA_TABLE);
await dynamodbDoc.send(putCommand);
console.log('‚úÖ Mock wallet stored successfully in DynamoDB for user:', userId);
```

### 2. Deployed Updated Lambda
- **Function**: `preprod-safemate-user-onboarding`
- **Handler**: `index-simple.handler`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Successfully deployed
- **Code Size**: 2,572 bytes

## Expected Behavior Now
1. **Wallet Creation**: `/onboarding/start` creates wallet AND stores it in DynamoDB
2. **Wallet Status**: `/onboarding/status` should now find the stored wallet
3. **Frontend Flow**: Should complete successfully without "wallet not found" errors

## Environment Variables Used
- `WALLET_METADATA_TABLE`: `preprod-safemate-wallet-metadata`
- `WALLET_KEYS_TABLE`: `preprod-safemate-wallet-keys`

## Next Steps
1. Test wallet creation flow in preprod
2. Verify wallet persistence works correctly
3. Address remaining user profile update error (if needed)

## Status
**COMPLETED** - Wallet persistence issue fixed and Lambda deployed.
