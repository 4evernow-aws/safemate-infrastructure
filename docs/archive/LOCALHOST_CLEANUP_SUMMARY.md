Found **439 localhost references** throughout the codebase that were causing CORS and connectivity issues in the preprod environment.

## Critical Files Fixed

## Impact

- ✅ Preprod environment now properly configured
- ✅ All API Gateway endpoints should work with preprod frontend
- ✅ Lambda functions now use wildcard CORS for flexibility

## Next Steps
1. Deploy updated Lambda functions to preprod
2. Apply Terraform changes if needed
3. Test wallet creation functionality
4. Verify all API endpoints work correctly

## Status
**COMPLETED** - Critical localhost references have been removed from preprod configuration files.
