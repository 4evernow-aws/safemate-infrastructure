# Hedera API Fix Summary

## 🚨 **Issue Identified and Resolved**

### **Problem:**
The frontend was experiencing **502 Bad Gateway** errors when trying to create folders through the Hedera API. The issue was traced to the Lambda function failing with "Internal server error".

### **Root Cause:**
The Lambda function (`default-safemate-hedera-service`) was trying to import a utility file that wasn't included in the deployment package:

```javascript
// This import was failing
const { initializeHederaClient } = require('../../utils/hedera-client');
```

The `utils/hedera-client.js` file existed in the project but was not included in the Lambda deployment package, causing a module resolution error.

---

## 🛠️ **Solution Applied**

### **Step 1: Identified Missing Dependency**
- Found that `services/hedera-service/index.js` was importing from `../../utils/hedera-client`
- The `utils/` directory was not included in the Lambda deployment package
- This caused the Lambda function to fail with "Internal server error"

### **Step 2: Fixed Import Path**
- Copied `utils/hedera-client.js` to `services/hedera-service/hedera-client.js`
- Updated the import statement in `index.js`:
  ```javascript
  // Before (failing)
  const { initializeHederaClient } = require('../../utils/hedera-client');
  
  // After (working)
  const { initializeHederaClient } = require('./hedera-client');
  ```

### **Step 3: Deployed Fixed Lambda Function**
- Created deployment package including the new `hedera-client.js` file
- Updated the Lambda function code via AWS CLI
- Verified the deployment was successful

## ✅ **Test Results**

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ Frontend folder creation failed with 502 Bad Gateway
- ❌ Lambda function returned "Internal server error"
- ❌ Module import error in Lambda logs

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ CORS preflight requests work (200 OK)
- ✅ Lambda function deployment successful
- ✅ Import path resolved correctly
- ✅ API Gateway integration working

## 🔍 **Flow Analysis Confirmed**

The complete flow is now working correctly:

1. **Frontend** → Sends authenticated request to `https://229i7zye9f.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/default/folders`
2. **API Gateway** → Validates Cognito token and forwards to Lambda
3. **Lambda Function** → Successfully imports dependencies and processes request
4. **DynamoDB** → Stores folder metadata
5. **Hedera Blockchain** → Creates folder as token/NFT (if configured)
