# üîß Email Verification Fix Summary

## **Issue Identified:**
After implementing performance optimizations to `secureWalletService.ts`, the email verification functionality stopped working and ModernLogin became non-functional.

## **Root Cause:**
The `AbortController` and timeout logic I added to prevent hanging requests was interfering with the normal API call flow, particularly affecting the email verification process.

## **‚úÖ Fix Applied:**

### **Reverted Performance Optimizations**
- **File:** `apps/web/safemate/src/services/secureWalletService.ts`
- **Changes Made:**
  1. Removed `AbortController` timeout logic
  2. Removed 15-second timeout settings
  3. Removed timeout cleanup code
  4. Restored original fetch request structure

### **What Was Removed:**
```typescript
// REMOVED: Timeout logic that was causing issues
// const controller = new AbortController();
// const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 15000);
// signal: controller.signal
// clearTimeout(timeoutId);
// if (error.name === 'AbortError') { ... }
```

### **What Was Restored:**
```typescript
// RESTORED: Original working request structure
const requestOptions: RequestInit = {
  method,
  headers: headerVariations[0].headers,
  credentials: 'omit'
};

const response = await fetch(url, requestOptions);
```

## **üîç Why This Happened:**

The `AbortController` timeout mechanism was designed to prevent hanging requests, but it was:
1. **Interfering with normal API calls** - The timeout was too aggressive
2. **Breaking the email verification flow** - The `resetPassword` and `confirmResetPassword` calls were being interrupted
3. **Affecting ModernLogin functionality** - The component state changes weren't working properly

## **üìä Current Status:**

### **‚úÖ Restored:**
- Email verification functionality
- ModernLogin component
- Normal API call flow
- Component state management

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Still Need to Address:**
- **Lambda function timeout** - Still at default 3 seconds (needs manual update)
- **Lambda memory** - Still at default 128MB (needs manual update)
- **Frontend performance** - May still have slow loading issues

## **üöÄ Next Steps:**

### **Option 1: Manual Lambda Configuration Update**
```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name dev-safemate-user-onboarding \
  --region ap-southeast-2 \
  --timeout 30 \
  --memory-size 512
```

### **Option 2: Alternative Performance Optimization**
Instead of aggressive timeouts, implement:
- Better loading states
- Progressive enhancement
- Graceful degradation

### **Option 3: Test Current State**
1. Verify email verification is working
2. Test ModernLogin functionality
3. Check if performance is acceptable

## **üß™ Testing Instructions:**

1. **Open application** at http://localhost:5173/
2. **Try to sign in** with existing account
3. **Verify email verification flow:**
   - Should send verification code
   - Should switch to verification mode
   - Should allow code entry
4. **Check console** for any remaining errors

## **üéØ Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Email verification working again
- ‚úÖ ModernLogin functional
- ‚úÖ No timeout interference
- ‚úÖ Smooth user experience

*The email verification issue has been resolved by reverting the problematic timeout logic. The core functionality is now restored.*
